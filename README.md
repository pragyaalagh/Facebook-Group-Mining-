# Facebook-Group-Mining

# This code is to make use of the Facebook's Graph API with the python libraries Json and Requests, to mine the data of a facebook group, to help the admins efficiently manage the group.

# Even though existing modules like facepy and facebook exist for modules, none of these are effictively able to mine a facebook group and retrieve specific posts from the group to create a record of the group posts for admins.

# The effictive way that I was able to do this was by using the Json and Requests Library in Python and retrieve data from the urls of the Graph API using the Graph API explorer.
